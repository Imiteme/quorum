Finished building your Blast database(s).

makeblastdb results are located in quorum/log/makeblastdb.log.

===================================================================

Quorum Manual Setup:

1. Add the newly created Blast database directories in
   quorum/blastdb to config/quorum_settings.yml. Update
   RAILS_ENV settings.

   See config/quorum_settings.yml for instructions.

2. Migrate the database.

     rake quorum:install:migrations

     rake db:migrate

3. Tar and compress quorum.

     tar -czvf quorum.tar.gz quorum/

4. Copy newly created tarball to remote machine.

     scp quorum.tar.gz <username>@<host>:/path/to/install

5. Expand the tarball on the remote machine.

     tar -xzvf quorum.tar.gz

6. Ensure quorum script dependencies are added to the remote
   machine's PATH. If the remote machine doens't have a .bashrc
   file, create one 

     touch ~/.bashrc

   and add script dependencies to the PATH.

     vim ~/.bashrc
     export PATH=/path/to/dependencies:$PATH

7. Bounce your web server to enable quorum..
